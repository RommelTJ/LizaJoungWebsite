                    The solution was simple. I needed a website in order to showcase my work in order to get hired to do
                    more work. The only issue was that I had a big case of imposter syndrome. I didn't have any previous
                    jobs specifically designated for design and I had never coded anything before. But those set backs
                    didn't stop me from trying anyway.
                </p>
                <p class="titleWorkDescription">
                    "If I hadn't had a design job before why was I interested in one now?" you might ask. And I would
                    say, because of three reasons.
                </p>
                <p class="titleWorkDescription">
                    Reason 1. I love to create. I love to make things from scratch or to revamp and revitalize old
                    objects. I knit. I podcast. I design. I create. I make. I do. And I wanted a profession where I
                    could do that full time. Reason 2. I have fantastic taste. I know what looks and feels good. I have
                    been blessed as a tastemaker which means everything I create (Reason 1) measures up to my taste
                    (Reason 2). Sometimes I fail but I know that I fail. And next time I do better.Reason 3. I want a
                    career and not just another job. I have held positions in retail, in call centers, and in various
                    internships. All of those positions were unfulfilling and frustrating. If I was going to spend most
                    of my adult life defining who I was based on a job then I wanted to make sure that the work I
                    produced matched up with my first two reasons. I needed to create. And I needed to create beautiful
                    and functional things.

                    The first step was to narrow down which creative field I wanted to get into. I settled on user
                    experience design after a lot of research and soul searching. I agreed with the UX principles of
                    research and advocating for the consumer. I wanted to base my design principles on numbers and
                    experiences instead of choosing what was fashionable or popular in design at the time. I also wanted
                    to focus on creating functional items that happened to be beautiful instead of beautifully useless
                    products. After examining UX principles and portfolios I wrote down a list of what I would need for
                    my own website and began to follow the guidelines set forth in those articles. I used a pencil and
                    paper first to quickly visualize what layouts would work best and thought deeply about how I wanted
                    to structure the information set forth.

            <p class="titleWorkDescription">
                I looked at hundreds of portfolios and websites of designers before approaching the design process. I
                wanted to ensure that the overall feel of the website remained professional and highlighted my
                experiences while also embedding my personality throughout. The color palette for example came from
                websites that were minimal and timeless in their aesthetic while also imposing a professionalism that
                was lacking from other websites that used bright colors and gradient based backgrounds. I came up with a
                muted color palette and ultimately chose black and white for a timeless feel. After the design was
                settled upon I then took steps to learn HTML and CSS to bring my designs to life. Using both online
                courses and advice from a software engineer I just happened to know, molding and shaping my designs into
                code became an exhilarating and frustrating experience. I didn't realize the amount of problem solving
                and attention to detail it required, but slowing down and focusing helped me understand how to correctly
                implement my designs. And when it all came together, it was cause for celebration.
            <p class="titleWorkDescription">
                The most exciting aspect of this project was the realization that I was falling more in love with UX
                design and its possibilites for my future. I learned invaluable skills when it came to HTML/CSS and want
                to continue to improve in my research and coding skills as my career takes off.
