 				"Why would I want to use an ugly tool while knitting beautiful items?" I thought as I looked through the row counters on the App Store. The apps available were not visually appealing and/or did not include all the functions I needed. Armed with my imagination and a thirst to tackle my first app design, I got to work thinking of ways to create a row counter that was simple and engaging, thus the KnitCount app was born.
 			</p>
 			<p class="titleWorkDescription">
 				I started by conducting a competitive analysis of the similar apps already available. Thorougly investingating which aspects I liked and disliked proved to be beneficial in determining what was absolutely necessary for a most viable product (MVP).
			</p>
            <ol type="1">
				<li class="menu"> I wanted a row counter that could count, decrease and reset. </li>
				<li class="menu"> I needed four separate counters that included row, repeat, increase and decrease for any given project. </li>
				<li class="menu"> I needed the ability to add multiple projects and a way to differentiate between them. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="titleWorkDescription">
				With those details in mind I got to work sketching possible layouts for the app with my trusty pencil and notebook. After finalizing what layout best suited the user interface, the details were finetuned in Sketch. I decided on a yarnball as the counter and knit stitches for the background to engage the target audience: other knitters. I added a "customize" page to include which counters would be available for a specific project and added varying colors to quickly differentiate between multiple projects. A separate page that listed all the projects would serve as a place to quickly change between them.

        The round of feedback after the initial design stated the colors were too bright for the screen. Once the colors were tweeked I gave the final design to my partner, Rommel Rico, who coded the app and released it to the App Store. The most exciting part of this process was the satisfaction of completing my first app.

        Throughout the process I learned how to compromise with specific design features due to time restrictions. I also learned the importance of communication and detailing exactly what needed to be completed and when. Overall this experience gave me the skills necessary to think about solutions in a mobile-first frame of mind which will be utilized in future design processes.
